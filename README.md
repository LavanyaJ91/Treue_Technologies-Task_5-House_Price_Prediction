# Treue_Technologies-Task_5-House_Price_Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting house prices using various machine learning algorithms. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and more.

INTRODUCTION:

    Predicting house prices is a fundamental problem in real estate and finance. In this project, we analyze a dataset containing house-related features and their corresponding prices. The goal is to develop and compare different machine learning models to accurately predict house prices based on the provided features.

IMPORTING LIBRARIES:

    Importing the libraries are Numpy, pandas, matplotlib
    Linear regression, decision tree, Random forest, Lasso SVR classifications

UPLOADING THE CSV FILE:

     Uploading the CSV file using the pandas library And reading the CSV file

     plot the seaborn plot of the price column using a histogram plot

     To check the shape, info, and description of the given datasets

     Plotting the seaborn plot for the price column using distplot and heatmap
     
PERFORMING THE EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:

     Removing the null values using isnull.sum()

     To find the Mean, Median, and mode of the given datasets
     and plot the histogram plot
ENCODE THE DATASET:

     to Encode the given dataset using a Label encoder
SPLIT THE DATA:

     To split the train and test Data using Train and test splitting
MODEL FITTING:

     To building the models are Linear Regression, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random forest, SVR Classifier

     To fit the models in train and test data and calculating the accuracy for given data
CONCLUSION:

     By comparing different machine learning models based on the r2 score 
     It is found that the Random Forest Model works best for this dataset.
